Operational risks can disrupt data center operations and affect service delivery. Key risks include:

## 1. Power Outages
- **Risk**: Frequent power outages in Mumbai can disrupt operations.
- **Mitigation**: Install backup power generators and UPS systems to ensure an uninterrupted power supply.

## 2. Network Failures
- **Risk**: Connectivity issues or network failures could impact the data center's functionality.
- **Mitigation**: Establish redundant network connections and regularly test failover systems to maintain network reliability.

## 3. Human Errors
- **Risk**: Mistakes made by personnel can lead to data loss or system failures.
- **Mitigation**: Provide regular training for staff, establish clear protocols, and implement access controls to minimize the impact of human error.
