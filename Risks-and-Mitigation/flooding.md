# Flooding

## Risk
Mumbai is prone to heavy rains and flooding during the monsoon season, which poses a significant risk to the data center's infrastructure.

## Mitigation Strategies
- **Site Selection**: Locate the data center on higher ground to minimize flood risk.
- **Drainage Systems**: Install adequate drainage systems to divert excess water away from the facility.
- **Waterproofing Measures**: Implement waterproofing techniques for critical areas and use water-resistant materials in construction.
- **Emergency Plans**: Develop and maintain an emergency response plan to address potential flooding incidents.
