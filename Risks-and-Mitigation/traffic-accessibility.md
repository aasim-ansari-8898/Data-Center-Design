# Traffic and Accessibility

## Risk
Mumbai's heavy traffic can pose challenges, potentially delaying response times during emergencies or maintenance.

## Mitigation Strategies
- **Remote Monitoring**: Establish remote monitoring and management capabilities to address issues without requiring physical presence.
- **Location Selection**: Choose a location with good connectivity and less traffic congestion to facilitate easier access.
- **Emergency Response Plan**: Create a plan that includes alternative routes and strategies for quick access during peak traffic times.
- **Staff Training**: Train staff on efficient travel routes and emergency procedures to minimize response times.
