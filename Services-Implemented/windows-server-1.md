# Windows Server 1: Services Implemented

Windows Server 1 is dedicated to critical network services. The implemented services include:

- **Active Directory (AD)**: Manages user accounts, group policies, and security for the network.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Translates domain names into IP addresses, allowing for easy access to resources on the network.
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**: Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on the network, simplifying network management.

These services are essential for maintaining the overall functionality and security of the data centerâ€™s network infrastructure.
