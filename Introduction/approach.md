# Approach

The approach to designing the data center involves the following key steps:

1. **Active Directory Setup**: Create an Active Directory (AD) to manage host accounts, enabling centralized user management and access control.
   
2. **Server Configuration**: Install DNS and DHCP services on the primary server to facilitate network operations. Host the DMS and ERP applications on dedicated servers to enhance performance and reliability.

3. **Email Server Setup**: Configure an email server with POP and IMAP services to support internal and external communication.

4. **Network Segmentation**: Utilize VLANs to segment network traffic, ensuring secure access for customers and auditors while isolating them from internal resources.

5. **Security Measures**: Implement regular data backups, cybersecurity protocols, and environmental controls to maintain data integrity and availability.

6. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Establish remote monitoring and management capabilities to handle issues promptly and maintain operational efficiency.
